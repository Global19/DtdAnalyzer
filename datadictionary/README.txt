DataDictionary

Application usage is:
java -jar datdictionaryapplication.jar [xml] [xsl] [output] {optional: catalog}

Where:
   xml     = xml instance filename
   xsl     = xsl instance
   output  = file to which output will be written
   catalog = OASIS catalog for entity resolution

The following jar files are required.  If you execute this as a jar file (with the "-jar"
option) then these need to be in the same directory as the datadictionaryapplication.jar.
  - resolver.jar
  - saxon.jar
  - xercesImpl.jar
  - xml-apis.jar

The executable class is gov.pubmedcentral.dtd.documentation.Application.

List of additional directories:
  - etc: holds the dtd of the intermediate XML generated by the application
  - src: source code
  - xslt: contains XSL that creates the data dictionary
  - script: contains the datadictionary.sh script that can be used to run it.
