<!--~~ Banana Split Example DTD

This is a sample DTD to illustrate and to test various features of the
DtdAnalyzer.

This is the main ".dtd" module of this DTD.  These notes will be inserted into
the main index.html page of the documenation.  Note that since this is the main
module, we should use the "!dtd" annotations, and not any "!module" annotations
here.

Here is how you make links to other documentation pages:

* Element tags must be preceded with a backtick:  \`\<split> -> `<split>.
* Attribute:  \@instrument -> @instrument
* Parameter entity:  \%banana.ent; -> %banana.ent;
* General entity:  \&fleegle-pic; -> &fleegle-pic;

~~-->

<!--~~ <split>
Specifies the main ingredients of a banana split.
Remember the following:

* One banana,
* Two banana,
* Three banana,
* Four.

~~ model
Four bananas make a bunch and so do many more.

~~ tags
root rock-group mess-of-fun

~~ examples
    <split>
      <banana instrument='guitar'>Fleegle</banana>
      <banana instrument='drums'>Bingo</banana>
      <banana instrument='bass'>Drooper</banana>
      <banana instrument='keyboard'>Snorky</banana>
    </split>

~~ schematron
  <report test='count(banana) &lt; 4'>
    You need four bananas to make a bunch.  Many more is okay, too.
  </report>

<!ELEMENT split (banana)*>

<!--~~ %inline.ent;
This entity declares some "core" things, that really just happen to be a few
elements that look suspiciously like HTML.
~~-->

<!ENTITY % inline.ent PUBLIC "-//NLM//external ent dummy public id 1//EN" "core/inline.ent">
%inline.ent;

<!--~~ %banana.ent;
In the split DTD, we bring in the banana.ent module in order to get all the 
slippery things assocatied with bananas.
~~-->

<!ENTITY % banana.ent PUBLIC "-//NLM//external ent dummy public id 2//EN" "banana.ent">
%banana.ent;
